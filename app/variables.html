      <h4>JavaScript</h4>

      <p>Variables are not typed when they are declared. JS will figure it out for you, though you can cast variables to a specific type if needed.</p>

      <p><em>Examples</em></p>

      <code>var favoriteColor = "purple";</code><br />
      <code>let favoriteAnimal = "cat";</code><br />
      <code>var favoriteNumber = 3;</code><br />

      <br />

      <p>Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement. The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be redeclared. The convention is to name constants in all uppercase.</p>

      <p><em>Examples</em></p>

      <code>const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;</code><br />

      <code>$favoriteColor = "purple";</code><br />

      <br />

      <p>A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script. The convention is to name constants in all uppercase.</p>

      <p><em>Examples</em></p>

      <code>define('DAYS_IN_WEEK', '7');</code><br />    
      <code>const MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12;</code><br />
