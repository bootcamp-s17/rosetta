      <p>Conditional statments include statements that make a decision to run or not, based on given information. This allows the flow of a program to change based on the statements given.</p>

      <p>if and else: If statments are used once to change something in the code if a condition is met. It lacks an iterative property.</p>

      <p><em>if/else if/else</em></p>

      <code>var x;                         <br />
          if (x>10){                       <br />
       console.log("x is greater than 10");<br />
       }                                   <br />
      else if (x<=10){                     <br />

      else {console.log(x isn't a number);}<br />            
          </code><br />

      <p>for: used to evaluate an expression a predetermined number of times.</p>

      <p><em>for</em></p>

      <code>
        for (var i=0;i<=7;i++){ <br />
         console.log(i);        <br />
        }                       <br />
      </code><br />
  
  <p>while: functions similar to a for loop but without the set up. Performs the actions until the break condition is met.</p>

  <p><em>while</em></p>

  <code>
    var x = 0;                  <br />
        while(x<=7) {           <br />
         x+=1;                  <br />
        }                       <br />
      </code><br />
  
  <p>do{}while: works exactly the same as a while loop with one exception: It always runs once. Always.</p>

  <p><em>do{}while</em><p>

  <code>
   var x = 0;    <br />
   do {x++;      <br />
   }while(x<=7); <br />
   </code><br />
  
  
  <p>switch: In effect switch/case a set of if statments.</p>
