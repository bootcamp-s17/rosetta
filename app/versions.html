<h4>What is it and What is it For</h4>

<p>
  PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development Team. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

  <h6>Three main uses of PHP Include:</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Server-side scripting</li>
    <li>Command line scripting</li>
    <li>Writing desktop applications</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  PHP code may be embedded into HTML or HTML5 markup, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.[7]
</p>

<h5>Php 1</h5>

<p>PHP development began in 1995 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C,[10][11][12] which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI. Also had alot of pearl like funtionality but on the other hand lacked common language features like loops</p>

<h5>Php 2</h5>

<p>Origianlly, PHP wasnt intended as a new programming language but started gaining some momentum. Soon development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.</p>

<h5>Php 3/4</h5>

<p>Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>$_GET and $_POST introduced in a new thing called global supervariables which can be accessed from within functions without  having to use the global keyword</p>
</blockquote>

<h5>Php 5</h5>

<p>Soon after, the demand for more common object-oriented features increased immensely, and Andi came up with the idea of rewriting the objected-oriented part of the Zend Engine. Zeev and Andi wrote the "Zend Engine II: Feature Overview and Design" document and jumpstarted heated discussions about PHPâ€™s future. Although the basic language has stayed the same, many features were added, dropped, and changed by the time PHP 5 matured.
</p>
<p>
For example, namespaces and multiple inheritance, which were mentioned in the original document, never made it into PHP 5. Multiple inheritance was dropped in favor of interfaces, and namespaces were dropped completely. You can find a full list of new features in Chapter, "What Is New in PHP 5?" PHP 5 is expected to maintain and even increase PHPâ€™s leadership in the web development market. Not only does it revolutionizes PHPâ€™s objectoriented support but it also contains many new features which make it the ultimate web development platform.</p>

<h5>Php 7</h5>
<p>
  Zend Engine 3 (performance improvements[42] and 64-bit integer support on Windows[64]), uniform variable syntax,[47] AST-based compilation process,[65] added Closure::call(),[66] bitwise shift consistency across platforms,[67] ?? (null coalesce) operator,[68] Unicode codepoint escape sequence,[69] return type declarations,[50] scalar type (integer, float, string and boolean) declarations,[51] <=> "spaceship" three-way comparison operator,[70] generator delegation,[71] anonymous classes,[72] simpler and more consistently available CSPRNG API,[73] replacement of many remaining internal PHP "errors" with the more modern exceptions,[45] and shorthand syntax for importing multiple items from a namespace.[74]

							<h4>JavaScript?</h4>
							<h5>History</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>Created in 10 days in May of 1995.</li>
								<li>Originaly named Mocha, then changed to LiveScript, and finally named JavaScript on December of 1995.</li>
								<li>Since JavaScript was created in 10 days and there was not enough time to properly develop the language, there are some obvious problems. (JavaScript: The Good Parts).</li>
								<li>Editions include: </br>
								<ol>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 1</li>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 2</li>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 3</li>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 4</li>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 5</li>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 5.1</li>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 6</li>
									<li>ECMAScript(ES) 7</li>
								</ol>
								<li>ECMAScript(ES) 5 & ECMAScript(ES) 6 are significant versions.</li>
								<li><h6>ECMAScript(ES) 5</h6>
									<ol>
										<li>Adds "strict mode," a subset intended to provide more thorough error checking and avoid error-prone constructs. Clarifies many ambiguities in the 3rd edition specification, and accommodates behaviour of real-world implementations that differed consistently from that specification. Adds some new features, such as getters and setters, library support for JSON, and more complete reflection on object properties.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><h6>ECMAScript(ES) 6</h6>
									<ol>
										<li>The Sixth Edition, initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015)[12] adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, but defines them semantically in the same terms as ECMAScript 5 strict mode. Other new features include iterators and for/of loops, Python-style generators and generator expressions, arrow functions, binary data, typed arrays, collections (maps, sets and weak maps), promises, number and math enhancements, reflection, and proxies (metaprogramming for virtual objects and wrappers). As the first "ECMAScript Harmony" specification, it is also known as "ES6 Harmony."</li>
